# Reusable workflows

Reference documentation for the reusable (`workflow_call`) workflows that live in
[`.github/workflows/`](../.github/workflows) and are adopted by other
tuna-os repositories.

This is the org's central defaults repo. A reusable workflow here is a **public
API**: downstream repos call it by pinning `@main`, so a merge is live for every
caller at once — there is no version to hold a consumer back and no way to roll
back except another commit. Treat every input, default, and behaviour change as
breaking until you have confirmed it does not break a caller.

See [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for how a change to any of these paths lands
everywhere at once.

Inputs are grouped by responsibility below. `type` is the workflow-call input
type; `required: true` inputs must be supplied by every caller.

## Adopting a workflow

Every reusable workflow is called as a **job**, not a step. The caller keeps its
own `on:` trigger (the publish cadence and event type differ per repo) and
becomes a thin job that `uses:` the workflow with `@main`:

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-lint.yml@main
```

Two things are shared and two are per-caller:

- **Shared (defined by the reusable workflow):** the `runs-on` runner, the
  pinned action versions, the tool installation, and the job body.
- **Per-caller:** the `on:` trigger block, the `permissions:` block, and
  `secrets:` mapping (see the per-workflow sections for what each needs).

Because callers pin `@main`, you cannot point a caller at a feature branch with
`@my-branch` and expect it to stay there — that ref goes away when the branch is
deleted. Test against your branch (see [Testing changes before merge](#testing-changes-before-merge)),
then merge.

## Workflows

### reusable-ci-contract.yml

**Purpose.** Verifies that every green criterion in
.github/green-criteria.yml is actually
asserted by a *reachable* workflow (reachable = tied to an active trigger
through a `uses:` chain) and satisfies its freshness SLA. It is the check that
turns a list of desired CI properties into something CI proves.

**Inputs.**

| Input | Type | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `criteria-path` | string | no | `.github/green-criteria.yml` | Only if the criteria file lives elsewhere. |
| `workflows-dir` | string | no | `.github/workflows` | Only if workflows are not under the standard path. |
| `python-version` | string | no | `"3.11"` | Only to match a pinned Python; the check uses PyYAML only. |

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  ci-contract:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-ci-contract.yml@main
```

**Notes.** Exits `0` and skips if the criteria file is absent; exits `1` if the
workflows directory is missing. A criterion with a `gates` block but no
`freshness_sla_days`, or a gate that names a job/step which does not exist, is a
violation.

### reusable-fork-safety.yml

**Purpose.** Static verification that `pull_request` workflows survive execution
from a fork, where GitHub issues a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` and all repository
secrets are empty. It checks that (1) `pull_request` workflows declare explicit
`permissions`, (2) `pull_request_target` is not used without an explicit
exception, and (3) steps that write or reference secrets are guarded against the
fork case.

**Inputs.**

| Input | Type | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `workflows-dir` | string | no | `.github/workflows` | Only if workflows are not under the standard path. |
| `python-version` | string | no | `"3.11"` | Only to match a pinned Python; the check uses PyYAML only. |

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  fork-safety:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-fork-safety.yml@main
```

**Notes.** A step is considered guarded if the job `if`, the step `if`, its
`env`, or its `run` contains a fork guard such as
`github.event_name != 'pull_request'`, `head.repo.fork`, or
`steps.<id>.outputs` from a preflight job. `continue-on-error` on a step also
disarms the check for that step, so a write in a `continue-on-error` step is not
flagged — set `continue-on-error` deliberately.

### reusable-lint.yml

**Purpose.** Runs the org's static-analysis suite on shell scripts, YAML, JSON,
Justfiles, and workflows. Each check runs as its own matrix job so one failing
check does not cancel the others.

**Inputs.**

| Input | Type | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `checks` | string | no | `'["shellcheck", "yamllint", "json-validate", "actionlint", "justfmt"]'` | JSON array of checks. Each entry must be one of `shellcheck`, `yamllint`, `json-validate`, `actionlint`, `justfmt`. |

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-lint.yml@main

# Run only a subset, e.g. shellcheck and actionlint:
jobs:
  lint:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-lint.yml@main
    with:
      checks: '["shellcheck", "actionlint"]'
```

**Notes.** `checks` is parsed with `fromJSON`, so it must be a valid JSON array
of strings — a bare string like `shellcheck` (not `["shellcheck"]`) fails to
parse and fails the job. `actionlint` runs with `continue-on-error` and
`2>/dev/null` by design; it reports but does not block. `justfmt` only runs when
a top-level `Justfile` exists.

### ste-lint.yml

**Purpose.** Checks Markdown and prose files against
[ASD-STE100](https://asd-ste100.org/) (Simplified Technical English) with a
per-repo budget. The linter and its rules live in the
[`.github/actions/ste-lint`](../.github/actions/ste-lint) composite action and
travel with it, so no repository carries a copy that can drift. Callers keep
their own `on:` trigger and become a thin job.

**Inputs.**

| Input | Type | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `budget-file` | string | no | `.ste-budget` | File holding the repo's maximum tolerated findings. |
| `budget` | string | no | `""` | Fallback budget when `budget-file` does not exist. Empty means "read the file only". |
| `node-version` | string | no | `"24"` | Node version the linter runs on. |
| `run-tests` | boolean | no | `true` | Run the linter's own test suite. Set `false` to skip. |
| `runs-on` | string | no | `ubuntu-latest` | Runner label for the job. |
| `checkout-ref` | string | no | `""` | Ref to check out. Empty means the ref that triggered the caller. |

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  ste:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/ste-lint.yml@main
```

See [`.github/actions/ste-lint/README.md`](../.github/actions/ste-lint/README.md)
for what the check enforces, how to seed a budget, and how to opt a file out.

**Notes.** The checkout uses `fetch-depth: 0` because the advisory per-PR report
diffs the branch against its base (`github.base_ref`); a shallow checkout has no
base and the report degrades to whole-repo noise. On `pull_request` events the
advisory section reports only what the branch introduced and never decides
pass/fail — the budget gate does. An empty `github.base_ref` (non-PR events)
disables the advisory report and leaves the budget gate intact.

### reusable-scorecard.yml

**Purpose.** Runs [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action)
supply-chain security analysis and uploads the result to code scanning.

**Inputs.**

| Input | Type | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `publish-results` | boolean | no | `false` | Publish results to the OpenSSF REST API. Requires `id-token: write` (OIDC), which this workflow grants. |

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  scorecard:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-scorecard.yml@main
```

**Notes.** The job grants `security-events: write`, `id-token: write`,
`contents: read`, `actions: read`. To actually publish results set
`publish-results: true` and provide a token with the OpenSSF scope; leaving it at
the `false` default only uploads the SARIF to code scanning.

### reusable-first-contributor.yml

**Purpose.** Greets first-time contributors on issues and pull requests with a
welcome comment, once per author per repo. Bots (anything ending in `[bot]`,
`dependabot`, `github-actions`) are skipped.

**Inputs.**

| Input | Type | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pr_message` | string | no | Welcome block for first PRs | Rewrite the welcome text. It is passed through `env:` to `github-script`, not interpolated into code. |
| `issue_message` | string | no | Welcome block for first issues | Rewrite the welcome text. |

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  greet:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-first-contributor.yml@main
```

**Notes.** The job needs `issues: write` and `pull-requests: write`; the caller
must grant them (or use `secrets`/`permissions` so the job can post comments).
It determines first-timers by searching for prior issues/PRs by the same author;
a count > 1 means the author has contributed before and the greeting is skipped.

### reusable-pr-nudges.yml

**Purpose.** Delivers advisory reminders to a pull request derived from the files
it touches. It runs the caller repository's nudge script (default
`.github/scripts/pr-nudges.sh`) and never fails a PR — reminders go to the step
summary and as annotations, plus a PR comment when permissions allow.

**Inputs.**

| Input | Type | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `script-path` | string | no | `.github/scripts/pr-nudges.sh` | Path to the caller's nudge script. |

**Secrets.**

| Secret | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `token` | no | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Supply a token with comment scope if `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot post PR comments in your repo's policy. |

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  nudges:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-pr-nudges.yml@main
```

**Notes.** The job is disabled for drafts, `renovate[bot]`, and `dependabot[bot]`
via its `if:`. It checks out only `script-path` (sparse checkout) and reads the
PR file list with `gh api --paginate` so a large PR cannot hide a path on page
two — this works on forks because reading needs no write permission. If the
script is missing it exits `0` and skips.

### reusable-add-help-wanted.yml

**Purpose.** Automatically adds the `help wanted` label to unassigned issues
once they are labelled `help wanted` or `good first issue`.

**Inputs.** None.

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  help-wanted:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-add-help-wanted.yml@main
```

**Notes.** The job needs `issues: write`. It runs with `continue-on-error` so a
transient API failure never blocks; it is a no-op if the issue already has a
label or an assignee.

### publish-flatpak.yml

**Purpose.** Canonical build → GHCR → central index pipeline for tuna-os flatpak
apps (tuna-os/tunaos#1183). Callers keep their own `on:` trigger (publish cadence
differs per repo — tags-only, main+tags, PR-gated builds) and become a thin job
that `uses:` this with `secrets: inherit`.

**Inputs.**

| Input | Type | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `app-id` | string | **yes** | — | Flatpak application ID, e.g. `org.tunaos.finupdate`. |
| `manifest-path` | string | **yes** | — | Path to the flatpak-builder manifest. |
| `repo-name` | string | **yes** | — | `owner/repo` on the registry and in the central index, e.g. `tuna-os/finupdate`. |
| `archs` | string | no | `'["x86_64","aarch64"]'` | JSON array of architectures, limited to `x86_64` and `aarch64`. A preflight job fails the run before any build if the list is empty, has a duplicate, or names another value. Each arch is a separate build job and a separate index update. Unsuffixed `:latest` tracks `x86_64` when it is in the list, otherwise the first arch. |
| `flatpak-builder-image` | string | no | `gnome-50` | `flathub-infra/flatpak-github-actions` image tag (without the `ghcr.io/flathub-infra/flatpak-github-actions:` prefix). |
| `checkout-submodules` | boolean | no | `false` | Checkout submodules of the source. |
| `source-repo` | string | no | `''` | `owner/repo` to build from when the source is **not** the calling repo (e.g. republishing Ghostty from `tuna-os/blueshell`). Empty checks out the caller at the calling ref. |
| `source-ref` | string | no | `''` | Branch/tag/SHA within `source-repo`. Empty means that repo's default branch. Ignored when `source-repo` is empty. |
| `attach-bundles` | boolean | no | `false` | Build a `.flatpak` bundle per arch and attach it to the GitHub release on tag push. |
| `generate-cargo-sources` | boolean | no | `false` | Run `flatpak-cargo-generator` against `cargo-lock-path` before building. |
| `cargo-lock-path` | string | no | `Cargo.lock` | Cargo lock file path for the generator. |
| `cargo-sources-output` | string | no | `build-aux/cargo-sources.json` | Output path for the generated cargo sources. |
| `publish` | boolean | no | `true` | Push to GHCR and update the index. Set `false` for build-only validation (e.g. on `pull_request`). |
| `registry` | string | no | `ghcr.io` | Registry host. |

**Secrets.**

| Secret | Required | Default | When to change it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FLATPAK_INDEX_TOKEN` | **yes** | — | Token allowed to push `tuna-os/docs` (the central index). Map it with `secrets: inherit` or explicitly. |

**Usage.**

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    uses: tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/publish-flatpak.yml@main
    with:
      app-id: org.tunaos.finupdate
      manifest-path: build-aux/org.tunaos.finupdate.json
      repo-name: tuna-os/finupdate
    secrets: inherit
```

**Notes.**

- The job takes `contents: write` (checkout + `gh release upload`) and
  `packages: write` (GHCR push + index push). The caller must grant them or let
  `secrets: inherit` + the workflow's own `permissions:` handle it.
- `source-repo` lets a caller publish an app whose source lives elsewhere. The
  upstream repo is checked out untouched and built with its own manifest, so
  upstream dependency/runtime bumps need no action here. The app still lands on
  the registry and index under `repo-name`.
- `publish` is a matrix with one job per planned arch. Each job downloads its
  own OCI artifact, pushes its own arch tags, and calls `publish-flatpak-index`
  with its own clone/retry/push cycle against `tuna-os/docs`.
- `attach-bundles` only runs on tag pushes (`startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')`).
- Not used by `tuna-os/Tavern`: it has a prod/main branch split and a promotion
  flow this workflow does not model (tuna-os/tunaos#1183).

## Common patterns and anti-patterns

| Do | Avoid |
|---|---|
| Call a reusable workflow as a **job** (`jobs.x: uses:`). | Calling it as a **step** — `workflow_call` jobs cannot run inside another job's `steps:`. |
| Pin `@main`; let the org own versioning. | Pinning a SHA or a branch name that will be deleted. |
| Keep the `on:` trigger and `permissions:` on the caller. | Moving triggers into the reusable workflow — the org workflow has no trigger of its own by design. |
| Map secrets explicitly or use `secrets: inherit`. | Relying on implicit secret availability; fork runs have empty secrets. |
| Change a default only after checking callers (`git grep` the org for the workflow). | Renaming an input or changing what a default means — callers break silently at their next run. |
| For `reusable-lint`, pass a JSON **array** in `checks`. | Passing a bare string; `fromJSON` on a non-array fails the job. |
| Seed `ste-lint` with the current finding count, not `0`. | Setting a budget of `0` — a gate that fails on day one gets disabled on day two. |

## Testing changes before merge

Callers pin `@main`, so **a merge is live for every caller immediately**. Do not
merge unverified. Two complementary strategies:

**1. Test the underlying tooling locally.** Most reusable workflows are thin
wrappers; verify the thing they actually run before touching the `uses:` line.

- `ste-lint`: run the linter from a checkout of this repo —
  `node .github/actions/ste-lint/ste-lint.mjs --summary`, or `just ste`. For
  per-PR detail: `node .github/actions/ste-lint/ste-lint.mjs --changed-only
  --base origin/main --format json`.
- `reusable-lint`: run the same tools locally (shellcheck, yamllint, jq,
  actionlint, `just --fmt --check`). `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`
  catches workflow-syntax errors before they reach CI.
- `reusable-ci-contract` / `reusable-fork-safety`: they run an embedded Python
  heredoc (PyYAML). Reproduce by running the equivalent script against your
  local `.github/workflows` and criteria file.
- `publish-flatpak`: run with `publish: false` for a build-only validation that
  never touches GHCR or the index.

**2. Exercise the real workflow from your branch.** Because callers pin `@main`,
a PR to `tuna-os/.github` runs the *existing* workflow, not your edited one. To
see your change execute against a real event:

1. Push your branch to your fork: `git push -u origin guide/workflow-inputs-docs`.
2. In your fork, add a temporary caller that points at your branch ref:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     test:
       uses: <your-fork>/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-lint.yml@<your-branch>
   ```
3. Trigger it (`workflow_dispatch`) and observe. Only after it behaves as
   intended do you merge to `main`.

For composite actions a reusable workflow depends on (e.g. `ste-lint` and
`publish-flatpak-index`, both referenced at `@main` from within these
workflows), the same branch-ref trick applies to the action's own caller.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `reusable-lint` job fails to start with a JSON parse error | `checks` is not a valid JSON array | Quote a JSON array: `checks: '["shellcheck"]'`, not `checks: shellcheck`. |
| `ste-lint` advisory report on a PR lists the whole repo, not just the diff | Shallow checkout (`fetch-depth < 0` missing) | The workflow fetches full history; if you forked the workflow, keep `fetch-depth: 0`. |
| `ste-lint` passes on `push` but the advisory is empty on a PR | `github.base_ref` is only set on `pull_request` | The advisory is intentionally disabled off-PR; the budget gate still runs. |
| Fork run fails on a step that works in the same-repo run | Forks get a read-only token and empty secrets | Guard the step with `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` or a preflight check; never rely on secrets in a `pull_request` path. |
| `reusable-fork-safety` flags a `pull_request_target` workflow | `pull_request_target` exposes secrets to untrusted code | Switch to `pull_request`, or add an explicit, documented exception in the workflow. |
| `publish-flatpak` index push is rejected (`fetch first`) | Concurrent publishes race on `tuna-os/docs` | Expected — the action retries with backoff. Frequent rejects mean publishing two apps in the same push window; the retry handles it. |
| `publish-flatpak` fails `missing oci-x86_64` | `download-artifact` with a single-match `pattern` flattens into the job root | The workflow downloads each arch by explicit name+path, not by pattern; do not change this to a glob. |
| `reusable-ci-contract` reports "not reachable" | A gate workflow is not tied to an active trigger through a `uses:` chain | Wire the gate into a workflow with a live trigger (`push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, …). |
| `reusable-ci-contract` reports "missing freshness_sla_days" | A criterion has a `gates` block but no freshness SLA | Add `freshness_sla_days` to that criterion. |
| `reusable-first-contributor` never greets | Author already has a prior issue/PR, or is a bot | Expected for repeat contributors and `[bot]` / `dependabot` / `github-actions`. |
